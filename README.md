# About This Project

The following project is a [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) Mod Loader mod. It is a simple, fixed; free camera implementation that can rotate on all three axis (it can roll!) with additional support for the following features:

- Freeze Scene
- Toggle HUD
- Teleport
- Movement/Rotation Sensitivity

As this was created for the sole purpose of taking screenshots; there are not many customization features; the controls are fixed and primarily designed to be operated using a controller with two analog sticks.

# Demo
A demo of the free camera can be found here: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfxBN2ElmIM)
